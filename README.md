### [Beyond Constants: Mastering Python Enums](./mastering-enums/)

**Scheduled for:** PyCon IL 2025

**Abstract:** Explore advanced enum usage in Python: define methods, attach metadata, and create enums dynamically. Learn the benefits and pitfalls of the enum singleton to write more expressive and maintainable code.

This upcoming talk will share powerful techniques for using Python enums beyond simple constants, including adding extra data and methods to make code more expressive and dynamically generating enums from configuration files.
